# AFL-player-data-ANN
This code uses Australian Football League player data from 2012 to 2017 to predict match outcomes from the 2018 season. 

The training set takes all AVERAGE player data from 2012-2017. 
The test set takes all AVERAGE player data from 2018. 

This is just a small project I undertook more for learning than for real-world applications. If you see this and have any suggestions, they would be greatly appreciated!
